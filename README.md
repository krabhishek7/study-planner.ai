"Smart" AI-Powered Features
This is where you leverage AI, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs) and Machine Learning.

1. Intelligent Task Decomposition (using an LLM)

How it works: A user enters a broad goal like "Study for my Biology midterm." The AI breaks it down into a logical, structured list of topics and sub-topics.
AI Prompt Example: "You are an expert academic planner. A student needs to study for their Biology midterm, which covers chapters 4 through 7 of the textbook 'Campbell Biology'. Break this down into a detailed list of 45-minute study topics. Output the list in JSON format with 'topic' and 'estimated_time' keys."
User Benefit: Overcomes the initial "where do I even start?" paralysis.
2. Adaptive Scheduling & Dynamic Prioritization

How it works: The AI doesn't just place tasks on the calendar. It considers:
Deadlines: High-priority tasks get scheduled sooner and more frequently.
User's Energy Levels: Ask the user if they are a "morning person" or "night owl" and schedule difficult subjects during their peak focus times.
Task Difficulty: The AI can estimate or ask the user how difficult a topic is and allocate more time accordingly.
Automatic Rescheduling: If a user misses a session, the AI intelligently reshuffles the schedule to fit it in later, rather than just letting it pile up.
3. Spaced Repetition & Active Recall Integration

How it works: This is a killer feature for retention. Based on the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve, the AI automatically schedules short review sessions for topics you've already studied. For example:
Study "Cell Mitosis" on Day 1.
AI schedules a 10-min review for Day 2.
AI schedules another 5-min review for Day 7.
AI schedules a final review for Day 20.
AI's Role: Manage the complex scheduling of hundreds of these tiny review intervals for every topic.
4. Performance Analysis & Weak Spot Identification

How it works: After a study session or a practice quiz, the user can provide feedback (e.g., "I found this topic easy/hard" or "I scored 6/10 on the practice questions"). The AI uses this data to identify weak spots and prioritizes them for future study sessions.
AI's Role: A simple classification or regression model can learn the relationship between user feedback and topics, predicting which areas need more work.
5. Motivational Coaching & Burnout Prevention

How it works: The AI acts as a supportive coach.
Sends encouraging messages: "Great work completing that session! You're on track for your exam."
Detects overload: "You've scheduled 6 hours of solid study today. Make sure to take breaks! I've added a 15-minute walk for you this afternoon."
AI's Role (LLM): Generate personalized, context-aware motivational messages.
