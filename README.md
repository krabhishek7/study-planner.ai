 Key Features (from Basic to Advanced)
Hereâ€™s a feature list, broken down by complexity. The magic happens when you combine them.

Foundation Features (The Non-AI Core)
User Authentication: Secure login for users.
Subject & Goal Input: Users can add their courses, subjects, and major deadlines (e.g., "CHEM 101 Midterm on Oct 25th," "History Essay due Nov 10th").
Task Management: Ability to add, edit, and delete specific tasks and topics within a subject.
Calendar Interface: A clean daily, weekly, and monthly view of the schedule.
Notifications & Reminders: Basic push notifications for upcoming study blocks.
"Smart" AI-Powered Features
This is where you leverage AI, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs) and Machine Learning.

1. Intelligent Task Decomposition (using an LLM)

How it works: A user enters a broad goal like "Study for my Biology midterm." The AI breaks it down into a logical, structured list of topics and sub-topics.
AI Prompt Example: "You are an expert academic planner. A student needs to study for their Biology midterm, which covers chapters 4 through 7 of the textbook 'Campbell Biology'. Break this down into a detailed list of 45-minute study topics. Output the list in JSON format with 'topic' and 'estimated_time' keys."
User Benefit: Overcomes the initial "where do I even start?" paralysis.
2. Adaptive Scheduling & Dynamic Prioritization

How it works: The AI doesn't just place tasks on the calendar. It considers:
Deadlines: High-priority tasks get scheduled sooner and more frequently.
User's Energy Levels: Ask the user if they are a "morning person" or "night owl" and schedule difficult subjects during their peak focus times.
Task Difficulty: The AI can estimate or ask the user how difficult a topic is and allocate more time accordingly.
Automatic Rescheduling: If a user misses a session, the AI intelligently reshuffles the schedule to fit it in later, rather than just letting it pile up.
3. Spaced Repetition & Active Recall Integration

How it works: This is a killer feature for retention. Based on the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve, the AI automatically schedules short review sessions for topics you've already studied. For example:
Study "Cell Mitosis" on Day 1.
AI schedules a 10-min review for Day 2.
AI schedules another 5-min review for Day 7.
AI schedules a final review for Day 20.
AI's Role: Manage the complex scheduling of hundreds of these tiny review intervals for every topic.
4. Performance Analysis & Weak Spot Identification

How it works: After a study session or a practice quiz, the user can provide feedback (e.g., "I found this topic easy/hard" or "I scored 6/10 on the practice questions"). The AI uses this data to identify weak spots and prioritizes them for future study sessions.
AI's Role: A simple classification or regression model can learn the relationship between user feedback and topics, predicting which areas need more work.
5. Motivational Coaching & Burnout Prevention

How it works: The AI acts as a supportive coach.
Sends encouraging messages: "Great work completing that session! You're on track for your exam."
Detects overload: "You've scheduled 6 hours of solid study today. Make sure to take breaks! I've added a 15-minute walk for you this afternoon."
AI's Role (LLM): Generate personalized, context-aware motivational messages.
3. The Technical Stack & AI Implementation
Here's a plausible tech stack to build this:

Frontend:

Web: React, Vue.js, or Svelte.
Mobile: React Native or Flutter for cross-platform.
Backend:

Python (Recommended): With frameworks like Django or Flask. Python has the best ecosystem for AI/ML (libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch).
Node.js: With Express.js. Great for real-time features and handling many API calls.
Database:

PostgreSQL: Excellent for structured data like users, subjects, and scheduled events.
Vector Database (e.g., Pinecone, Chroma): If you add a "recommend study resources" feature, you'd use this to store embeddings of articles/videos for semantic search.
AI Implementation:

LLM API Calls: You don't need to train your own LLM! Use APIs from:
OpenAI (GPT-4 for quality, GPT-3.5-Turbo for speed/cost)
Anthropic (Claude 3 family is excellent for reasoning and long context)
Google (Gemini models)
AI Orchestration Frameworks:
LangChain or LlamaIndex: These Python/JS libraries are essential. They help you "chain" together LLM calls, connect them to your database, and manage prompts, making features like "Task Decomposition" much easier to build and maintain.
Custom ML Models: For features like "Performance Analysis," you could train a simple model using scikit-learn on your backend, hosted alongside your application.
