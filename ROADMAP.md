Phased Development Roadmap (How to Start)
Don't try to build everything at once.

Phase 1: The MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

Build the Foundation: User accounts, subject/task input, a simple calendar view.
Integrate ONE Key AI Feature: Start with Intelligent Task Decomposition. This provides immediate, tangible value to the user and is relatively straightforward to implement with an LLM API call.
Launch & Get Feedback: Get it into the hands of real students.

Phase 2: The "Smart" Core

Implement Adaptive Scheduling: Use algorithms to place tasks based on priority and deadlines.
Add Spaced Repetition: This will be your most powerful retention feature.
Introduce Performance Tracking: Start collecting user feedback on topic difficulty.

Phase 3: The Ecosystem

Build the Motivational Coach: Add personalized nudges and burnout warnings.
Resource Recommendation: Integrate a system to suggest relevant YouTube videos, articles, or practice problems.
Integrations: Allow syncing with Google Calendar, iCal, etc.
